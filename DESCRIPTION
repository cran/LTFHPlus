Description: Implementation of LT-FH++, an extension of
    the liability threshold family history (LT-FH) model.
    LT-FH++ uses a Gibbs sampler for sampling from the truncated 
    multivariate normal distribution and allows for 
    flexible family structures. LT-FH++ was first described in 
    Pedersen, Emil M., et al. (2022) 
    <doi:10.1016/j.ajhg.2022.01.009> 
    as an extension to LT-FH with more flexible family structures, 
    and again as the age-dependent liability threshold (ADuLT) model
    Pedersen, Emil M., et al. (2023) 
    <doi:10.1038/s41467-023-41210-z> 
    as an alternative to traditional time-to-event genome-wide
    association studies, where family history was not considered.
